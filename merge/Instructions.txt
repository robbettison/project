How to Play

The aim of the game is to win the race by going fastest and eating as many apples as possible!

If you eat nutritious apples then you will speed up.

Some apples are moldy and have worms in, but you can’t see them just by looking. These apples look the same! These moody apples will slow you down.

Luckily there is help! To know which fruits to eat, look in the top right corner. 

There you will find a binary hint. If you make the binary number by eating the correct apple, you shall be the fastest and win the race!

Beginner Level

What is Binary?

   -There are only two numbers in binary (1 and 0).
   - numbers look like this: 001100101

	Why are there only two numbers (0 and 1)?

	Bases:
	Base 10 has 10 numbers (0-9)
	Base 5 has 5 numbers (0-4)
	base 2 is also known as binary, it has 2 numbers (0-1).


Why is the binary system known as a ‘base 2’ system?

In binary the numbers are converted using the power of two.

Power of 2?

This means the number of times we multiply 2 by 2.

	- For example, 2 to the power of 3 is (2 x 2 x 2)
	  times 2 by 2, 3 times, which equals 8.

Here is a list of the first few power numbers of 2:

	2^0 = 1  (Maths rule, if you multiply any number zero it also equals one)
	2^1 = 2  (Maths rule, if you multiply any number 1 it always stays the same)
	2^2 = 4
	2^3 = 8
	2^4 = 16
	2^5 = 32 and so on...

Can also be written as:
 8  4  2  1
 --------------
 0  0  0  1		So the binary number 0001 means you just have a 1, so 1.
 0  1  0  1		So the binary number 0101 means you have a 4 and 1, so 5.
 1  1  1  1		So the binary number 1111 means you have 8,4,2 and 1, so 15.
 1  0  0  1		So the binary number 1001 means you have an 8 and 1, so 9.


Intermediate Level

Negative Numbers

	In the last section, we worked out how to convert numbers into binary numbers but
	we never mentioned how to do binary for a negative muber. (eg -4).

	You may remember in the last section that every number begins with a zero but
	the reason why wasn't explained fully.

	in the last section 0011 means 2 + 1 = 3.

	Notation

	In binary, a number is determined positive by the first number, if it starts with
	a 0 then it's postive or of it begins with a 1 then it's negative.

	The simplest way to think about is to imagine the furthest number left as negative, 
	then you can add on positive numbers to work out the exact negative value.

		(-8) 4  2  1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		 1   0  0  1		So the binary number 1001 means (-8) + 1, so -7.
		 1   0  1  1		So the binary number 1011 means (-8) + 2 + 1, so -5.
		 1   1  1  1		So the binary number 1111 means (-8) + 4+2+1, so -1.
		 1   0  0  0		So the binary number 1000 means (-8) + 0, so -8.


	Longer Examples:

	For larger numbers it folllows the same structure and pattern.

	Now 16 becomes the negative number since it's the largest/ furthest left.

		if you wanted to work out -10, you would do:

		(-16) 8  4  2  1  
	------------------------	
		  1   0	 1  1  0


Advanced 

Binary Arithmetic

We've now explored positive numbers and negative numbers, so that's it all right?

Almost, there is one last thing, we can add and subtract binary numbers from one another.

It is quite similar to normal addition and subtraction with numbers.

For example.

	Add 2 + 1 (0010 + 0001)

	0010
    +0001
 ----------
 	0011		which equals 3 when converted.


 	Subtract 5 from 3

 	0011  (3)
    +1011  (-5)
 ----------------
    1110  (-2)
