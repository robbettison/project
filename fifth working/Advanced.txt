Binary Arithmetic

We've now explored positive numbers and negative numbers, so that's it all right?

Almost, there is one last thing, we can add and subtract binary numbers from one another.


It is quite similar to normal addition and subtraction with numbers.

For example.

	Add 2 + 1 (0010 + 0001)

	0010
   +0001
 ----------
 	0011		which equals 3 when converted.


 	Subtract 5 from 3

 	0011  (3)
   +1011  (-5)
   -------
    1110  (-2)
