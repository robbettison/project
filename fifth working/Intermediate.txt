Negative Numbers

	In the last section, we worked out how to convert numbers into binary numbers but
	we never mentioned how to do binary for a negative muber. (eg -4).

	You may remember in the last section that every number begins with a zero but
	the reason why wasn't explained fully.

	in the last section 0011 means 2 + 1 = 3.

	Notation

	In binary, a number is determined positive by the first number, if it starts with
	a 0 then it's postive or of it begins with a 1 then it's negative.

	The simplest way to think about is to imagine the furthest number left as negative, 
	then you can add on positive numbers to work out the exact negative value.

		(-8) 4  2  1 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		 1   0  0  1		So the binary number 1001 means (-8) + 1, so -7.
		 1   0  1  1		So the binary number 1011 means (-8) + 2 + 1, so -5.
		 1   1  1  1		So the binary number 1111 means (-8) + 4+2+1, so -1.
		 1   0  0  0		So the binary number 1000 means (-8) + 0, so -8.


	Longer Examples:

	For larger numbers it folllows the same structure and pattern.

	Now 16 becomes the negative number since it's the largest/ furthest left.

		if you wanted to work out -10, you would do:

		(-16) 8  4  2  1  
	------------------------	
		  1   0	 1  1  0
